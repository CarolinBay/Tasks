# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add "name"`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit "name"`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `pressing q or git checkout ?`
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b name_branch`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
